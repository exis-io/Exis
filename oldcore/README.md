# Riffle Core

Riffle core logic, built into a library and linked with native wrappers. 

Each language library consists of the **core**, a **mantle**, and a **crust**. All libraries share a core, most libraries have their own mantle, and each has its own crust. Mantles and the core are written in Go while crusts are written in native languages. 

Currently, the following languages are supported: 

* Python
* Javascript
* Go
* Swift

Support for Java, especially with Android, is coming quickly.
