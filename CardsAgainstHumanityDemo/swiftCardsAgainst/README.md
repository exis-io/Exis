# Swift Cards Against Humanity Demo

This project is the result of a [tutorial on getting started with exis](http://docs.exis.io/#/pages/samples/SwiftCardsTutorial.md). All our docs live at [docs.exis.io](http://docs.exis.io). 

This project lives at https://github.com/exis-io/CardsAgainst. 

## Building the Example 

At least Xcode 7.1 and Swift 2.1 are required. 

This app contains an Xcode project with an app and a backend. The app displays the cards against humanity game while the backend maintains game state between players. The app and backend are separate folders and targets within the project. 

The backend can either run within a container (i.e. in the cloud) or locally on your computer. By default, you can clone the project and run it immediately on our hosted backend.
